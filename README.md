- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brendanduplessis , Also Known As : Brendan or Bren for short. I'm also 23 years old.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Development, as a junior I am constantly over fascinated by coding and learning new skills to improve my capabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and more , I finished a course with Vzap in 2021 and now I'm actively looking for a job or intership.
- 💞️ I’m looking to use my developer skills to build projects and learn more about software as my understanding around code comes naturally. #forthelogic
- 📫 Reach me on email or whatsapp (duplessisbrendan3@gmail.com)(+27 71 502 7835)

 🌱 My Lifestyle is an open book ; I keep busy from day to day either socially keeping in contact with my associates and family or friends / or you'll find me in front of a machine busy writing code or watching an interesting tutorial or documentary. Gaming is probably my favorite time consuming activity among other things like walking my Husky around nearby parks. 
 because technology is an every day presence in my life , my fascination with software started at a very young age. I have been asking questions on how data works before I even understood what data was. Today I can easily understand why , I will never get bored with this and I see myself developing software for the forseeable future.
 My hopes for the rest of the world is that they too can find a field of work where it never feels like work , but instead like you're paid to live your dreams. :)
